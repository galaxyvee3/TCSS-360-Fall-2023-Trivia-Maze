Description:
“Trivial Maze” is a maze-based game incorporating a user-design friendly interface, upon database integration. The objective of the game is for the user to exit. The users have to go through, starting at the entrance and reaching the exit by answering questions. The maze's various entry points make it more difficult for the user to find their way out, and when entering, a multiple choice question must be answered correctly. If users answer questions incorrectly, the door is permanently closed for them, and after several tries around the maze, a loss will occur as a result if the user can't get through the exit. Users playing the game can engage in an entertaining and interactive experience where their knowledge skills can be tested through many types of questions.
